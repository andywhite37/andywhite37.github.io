    <p>The world of typed functional programming is a vast, mind-blowing, and often
terrifying place. There are so many things to learn and so many rabbit holes
to go down, it&rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed, and not know where to even start.
For most of my software development career, I operated in blissful ignorance
of functional programming - I happily wrote object-oriented and imperative
code, mutating data and throwing all sorts of exceptions, and I was actually
pretty content with it. I didn&rsquo;t really see any reason to look into functional
programming at all.</p>

<p>About 5 years ago, I had the good fortune of working with another developer
named <a href="https://twitter.com/nuttycom">Kris Nuttycombe</a> whom I see as the
person who gave me my first solid kick down the road of functional
programming. He introduced my co-workers and me to the concepts of functors,
applicative validation, monads, semigroups, monoids, and all sorts of other
things. I didn&rsquo;t understand any of it initially, or if I did understand it, I
didn&rsquo;t get why I should care. I resisted, as many of these concepts cast
shade on my precious OO design patterns, but each time I tried to fight and
defend my stance, it just couldn&rsquo;t be done - functional programming (and
math) was just always right, and I was wrong. Every time.</p>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve observed over the past few years is that learning functional
programming is all about planting seeds and checking back on them later. Kris
would often say something that I didn&rsquo;t understand, and I would have to just
file it away to hopefully encounter it again later. There are all sorts of
monad tutorials out there, but to be honest, maybe 1 out of 20 of them really
clicked for me. It took quite a bit of reading to grasp many of these
concepts, so my purpose for writing this blog is to maybe plant a seed for
someone else. If you&rsquo;re trying to learn functional programming, my advice
would be to cast a wide net, and don&rsquo;t dwell on one resource for too long,
especially if it&rsquo;s not clicking for you. If the &ldquo;monads are burritos&rdquo; concept
seems odd or unhelpful to your understanding, move on! Burritos didn&rsquo;t help
me to learn monads, but implementing functor, applicative, and monad
instances for <code>List</code>, <code>Maybe</code> and <code>Either</code> did!</p>

<p>To preface these blog posts, I don&rsquo;t have a background in math, other than
the calculus and differential equations I did in an undergrad engineering
degree (which I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve really used at all). I don&rsquo;t have a
background in abstract algebra nor category theory, so I will likely misuse
terminology or miss important rigorous points. I&rsquo;m happy to be corrected, as
that helps me to solidify my understanding, much of which has been informally
self-guided. I&rsquo;m trying to approach these topics from a &ldquo;boots on the ground&rdquo;
perspective - a layman&rsquo;s guide to what I know about functional programming,
and why I think it matters.</p>

<p>Functional programming is one of the most interesting and satisfying things
to learn in the world of software development. It has a long history, it&rsquo;s
backed by years of research by some extrememly smart people, and really the
sky is the limit on how much you can learn and grow. I find it much more
satisfying to learn and apply these powerful abstractions than to try to keep
up with
<em>JavaScript Framework Du Jour</em> ™️. The key thing to remember is to not get
overwhelmed and to just take one step at a time, and build your knowledge up
over time.</p>
