    <p>Hi, my name is Andy White, and this is my personal website.</p>
<p>I live in Erie, Colorado (near Boulder) with my wife and three kids, and I
work as a full-stack software developer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in Colorado my whole life - I was born in Denver, grew up mostly
in Colorado Springs, and then bounced around the Denver metro area in my
adult life.</p>
<p>I attended the University of Colorado at Boulder, and studied
Electrical/Computer Engineering. After working in robotics, control systems,
and circuits labs in college, and frying my fair share of circuit boards and
components, I opted to pursue a career in software development rather than
electrical things. I love software development because all you need is a
computer, and you can do so many different things.</p>
<p>In my career, I&rsquo;ve used a variety of languages, including C, C++, Perl, Java,
Python, C#, JavaScript, Haxe, Scala, PureScript, Haskell, and ReasonML. My
current interest is in pure, typed functional programming languages and
concepts. The world of functional programming has opened my eyes to so many
new and powerful concepts, I&rsquo;m excited to continue learning, applying the
ideas, and growing my understanding.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I spend a lot of time with my wife and kids, and I enjoy
biking, playing guitar, and kayaking. (Or I&rsquo;d like to enjoy those things if I
could find any spare time.)</p>
<p>You can find me online on <a href="https://github.com/andywhite37">GitHub</a>, sometimes
on <a href="https://twitter.com/whitehouse3001">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://facebook.com/andywhite2">Facebook</a>, and almost never on
<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/andywhitesoftwaredeveloper">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
